. cnn_exceptions.py:
    -> Added ParameterError Exception
. cnn_util_eval.py:
    -> Added Eval.__create_bins_from_data()
    -> Added Eval.__save_fig()
    -> Changed Eval.plot_confusion_matrix():
        -> Added colour map selection
        -> Moved saving to Eval.__save_fig()
    -> Changed Eval.plot_histogram():
        -> Moved saving to Eval.__save_fig()
        -> Moved bin creation to Eval.__create_bins_from_data()
        -> Changed title creation
    -> Changed Eval.plot_accuracy():
        -> Moved bin creation to Eval.__create_bins_from_data()

. cnn_util_eval.py:
    -> Modified Eval.plot_accuracy():
        -> Added error bars
        -> Added parameter 'error_bars: bool = False'
        -> added parameter 'plot_at_center_of_bins: bool = True'
            -> If true, centers the data on centers of bins. In the process, the last data point
               is dropped.
    -> Modified bin creation behaviour:
        -> Providing an int to the parameter bins now properly creates the correct number of bins

        -> Modified plot axis labels
        -> Added xlbl, ylbl support (editing axis labels)
        -> Added legend
    -> Modified Eval.plot_histogram():
        -> Added legend
        -> Added xlim, ylim support
