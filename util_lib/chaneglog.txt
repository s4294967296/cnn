    -> Added Eval.__create_bins_from_data()
    -> Added Eval.__save_fig()
    -> Changed Eval.plot_confusion_matrix():
        -> Added colour map selection
        -> Moved saving to Eval.__save_fig()
    -> Changed Eval.plot_histogram():
        -> Moved saving to Eval.__save_fig()
        -> Moved bin creation to Eval.__create_bins_from_data()
        -> Changed title creation

04.03.22:
---------
. cnn_util_eval.py:
    -> Modified Eval.plot_accuracy():
        -> Added error bars
        -> Added parameter 'error_bars: bool = False'
        -> added parameter 'plot_at_center_of_bins: bool = True'
            -> If true, centers the data on centers of bins. In the process, the last data point
               is dropped.
    -> Modified bin creation behaviour:
        -> Providing an int to the parameter bins now properly creates the correct number of bins

        -> Modified plot axis labels
        -> Added xlbl, ylbl support (editing axis labels)
        -> Added legend
    -> Modified Eval.plot_histogram():

. Project-wide:
    -> Changed name to "CELFA - CNN Evaluation Library For ANNIE"
---------
02.04.22:
---------
. Project-wide:
    -> I did not keep up with the changelog. :(
. cnn_util_eval.py -> changed to celfa_eval.py
    -> etc.
. celfa_eval.py:
    -> Added / changed documentation for the following:
        . Evaluator() :
            -> get_cm_entry()
            -> select_stats_data_by_data_name()
            -> select_stats_data_by_category()
            -> __save_fig()
            -> __create_bins_from_data()
            -> get_auc()
            -> plot_roc()
            -> plot_percent_predicted()
            -> plot_prediction_confidence()
            -> plot_probability_histogram()
            -> plot_confusion_matrix()
            -> plot_histogram_real()
            -> plot_histogram()
        . Bundle():
            -> plot_percent_predicted()
            -> plot_prediction_accuracy()
            -> plot_probability_histogram()
    -> Modified behaviour:
        . Evaluator():
            . get_cm_entry():
                -> Previously "print_cm_entry()"
                -> Now returns instead of printing
            . print_category_count(): formatting
            . __create_bins_from_data:
                -> changed logic slightly
            . plot_roc():
                -> changed curve label
            . plot_percent_predicted():
                -> changed plot title
            . plot_prediction_confidence():
                -> changed behaviour of type(category)==list branch,
                    -> Will now call itself with every entry of category
            . plot_probability_histogram():
                -> changed plot title
            . plot_confusion_matrix():
                -> Selection of cmap is now by default "Blues"
                -> cmap will change to "Purples" when absolute is true
                -> title will change based upon value of absolute
        . Bundle():
            . plot_probability_histogram():
                -> density parameter added to hist
    -> Added features:
        . Evaluator():
            . plot_roc():
                -> support changing title
            . plot_percent_predicted():
                -> support saving
            . plot_prediction_confidence():
                -> support returning data
                -> support saving
                -> support calling itself multiple times when providing a list of categories
                -> support continuous/split style (kind of)
                -> support changing the title
            . plot_probability_histogram():
                -> support saving

    -> Added features:
        . Evaluator():
            . mrd_hist():
                -> Plot histogram of mrd data
                -> Choose which column of the data to plot
            . mrd_accuracy():
                -> Plot accuracy of identification vs mrd column data
